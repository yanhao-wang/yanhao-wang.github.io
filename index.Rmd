Hi! Welcome to my website!

I'm a PhD candidate at the department of [Business Economics and Public Policy](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/business-economics-public-policy/index.cshtml), [Kelley School of Business](https://kelley.iu.edu/), [Indiana University Bloomington](https://indiana.edu/).

I earned my Bachelor degree in Finance and Master's degree in Economics from [Antai College of Economics and Management](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was also an exchange student at [Smith School of Business](https://smith.queensu.ca/index.php), [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). 

I study the interplay between financial and healthcare markets. I'm also interested in applied econometrics and public/development economics.
