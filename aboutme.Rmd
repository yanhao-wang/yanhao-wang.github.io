I'm also a self-taught amateur astronomer. Here are some links I frequently use: \
[IU's Kirkwood Observatory](https://www.astro.indiana.edu/kirkwood.shtml) \
[Heavens Above](https://www.heavens-above.com/) \
  
I use the following chart to quickly assess the real-time weather conditions (Bloomington, IN):
