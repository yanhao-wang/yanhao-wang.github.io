<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >Little is known about how physicians' personal wealth affects their behavior. Using data on physicians' housing returns linked to their treatment choices, this paper provides new empirical evidence on the sensitivity of physicians' behavior to their wealth and studies the policy implications on medical expenditure and patient health. Specifically, I look at obstetricians who have large discretion and significant financial incentives in choosing cesarean sections over vaginal deliveries. For identification, I rely on the variation in obstetricians' housing returns arising from the Great Recession, depending on when or where they purchased their houses ex-ante. Using a patient-level regression model with obstetrician fixed effects, I estimate that a one-standard-deviation decrease in obstetricians' housing wealth leads to an increase of 1.8 percentage points, or 4.5%, in C-section probability. The increased C-section rate leads to longer in-hospital stays and higher infection rates among the patients. Finally, I show in two counterfactuals that the estimated wealth sensitivity is useful in predicting the effectiveness of price regulations and alternative payment models.</span></div>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >Group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, are pervasive in many settings, but the actual value of GPOs remains a constant topic of debate. We offer one of the first studies examining the effect of GPOs on supply expenses in the U.S. hospital setting. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in GPO scale (GPO market share weighted by member hospitals’ bed capacity) decreases an average hospital’s supply expenses by 2.7%, translating into an annual savings of more than half a million dollars. An event study analysis helps to foster a causal interpretation of our main findings. We find no evidence that GPOs reduce supply expenses at the cost of the quality of patient care or by means of changing the patient composition. Instead, we find some of the cost savings are passed to consumers in terms of lowered hospital prices, although only in highly competitive hospital markets. Our results contribute directly to the ongoing debates over the value of GPOs and more broadly to the literature on countervailing buyer power and intermediaries.</span></div>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >A firm often joins a group purchasing organization (GPO), hoping to benefit from the GPO’s economies of scale. While the practitioner’s evidence on this hope is mixed, academic attention is severely limited. We address this inattention in the empirical context of U.S. health care. We find that, on average, an increase of 1 standard deviation in the scale of a hospital’s GPO boosts the hospital’s number of patient admissions by 5% in the following year. We next test two mechanisms: (1) cost efficiency and (2) patient satisfaction. A parallel mediation model supports both mechanisms, with cost efficiency and patient satisfaction explaining 30% and 10% of the total effect, respectively. We also document that relative to their large counterparts, small hospitals benefit more from the GPO scale. Interestingly, for small (large) hospitals, cost efficiency (patient satisfaction) is the predominant mechanism. </span></div>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >In this paper, we explore how incumbent firms preemptively react to entry threats, and how their actions impact the strategic positioning of potential entrants. By merging insights from strategic positioning and strategic entry deterrence literature, we predict that incumbents will take preemptive actions to deter entry when entry threats are higher and that this deterrence will vary depending on the potential entrants’ legitimacy in the local market. We also expect new entrants to pursue a distinctive position if they persist in entering despite deterrence by incumbents. To test our predictions, we analyzed data from over 45,000 bank branches across 189 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2014 and leveraged quasi-experimental variation in entry threats from branching deregulation in the Chinese retail banking industry. The results provide strong support for our hypotheses.</span></div>

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >Prior studies have documented significant dispersion in productivity and quality in the healthcare sector. However, little is known about if and how external finance shapes this dispersion through technology adoption and diffusion. This paper answers this question using data on municipal bonds issued by U.S. hospitals merged with hospital-level adoption of surgical robots and Medicare claims data on prostate cancer surgeries. In 2007, several big bond insurers stopped issuing new municipal bonds because of unexpected and huge losses in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). I predict that the treated hospitals that have ex-ante relationships with the crashed insurers, as opposed to other hospitals that use unaffected insurers, find it harder to issue bonds or have to borrow at higher costs. Consequently, I predict that they adopt robots more slowly and less frequently, leading to smaller market shares and lower productivity.</span></div></details>

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em"><span style="color:Black; font-size: 12pt; font-family:'Georgia'" >During and following the 2007-09 financial crisis, the FDIC maintained financial stability and public confidence by auctioning the failed banks to healthier institutes. This paper examines the "side effects" of failed bank resolution on local banking competition, which is often neglected by financial regulators. I find that the local market concentration increased, especially in overlapping markets, which was mainly driven by branch closures after the failed bank was acquired. I also find that, in non-overlapping markets, the entry of a large acquirer can alleviate the anti-competitive effects in a way of booming aggregate outputs and improving service quality. Evidence shows that this is not only a result of the "replacement effect" in which the poor failing institute is replaced by the healthy acquirer but also a result of the "stimulus effect" in which surviving incumbents strive to attract the switching consumers.</span></div></details>
